      <h1>Tocker Bot Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: 25/06/2024</p>
      <h2>Proper Usage</h2>
      <p>You may use these commands as you would like within your server as long as what you are doing does not break discord's TOS.</p>
      <p>   
            <b>Tockr</b> bot stores <i>userIDs</i>. 
            We will ONLY store said ID if the bot requires it to complete actions within your server. 
            If you would like to delete your data, remove the projects and tasks created and they will be removed from the database permanently.
            All passwords saved via Tockr will be encrypted and will not be visible to the developer(s) in its plain text form in the database. 
            You can also join our support server to request personal data deletion.
      </p>
